# Plan

## Overview
[Brief summary of how this sprint will be executed.  
Mention the number of Strides, overall strategy, key concerns,  
and how the work ties back to the Proposal.]

---

## Strides
Strides are **sequential, outcome-based milestones**.  
Each Stride MUST contain tasks that are atomic and traceable to implementation logs.  
Strides MUST NOT overlap and MUST be executed in strict order.

Fill out each Stride as shown:

---

### **Stride 1: [Outcome / Milestone Name]**
**Purpose:**  
[Describe the milestone delivered by this Stride.]

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Task 1.1: [Atomic, single-action task]  
- [ ] Task 1.2: [Atomic, single-action task]  
- [ ] Task 1.3: [Atomic, single-action task]

**Completion Definition:**  
- [Describe the condition that marks this Stride as complete]  
- [Map to acceptance criteria from proposal.md]

---

### **Stride 2: [Outcome / Milestone Name]**
**Purpose:**  
[Describe the milestone delivered by this Stride.]

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Task 2.1:  
- [ ] Task 2.2:  
- [ ] Task 2.3:

**Completion Definition:**  
- [Describe the condition that marks this Stride as complete]  
- [Map to acceptance criteria]

---

### **Stride 3: [Outcome / Milestone Name]**
**Purpose:**  
[Describe the milestone delivered by this Stride.]

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Task 3.1:  
- [ ] Task 3.2:

**Completion Definition:**  
- [Describe the condition that marks this Stride as complete]  
- [Map to acceptance criteria]

---

## Approach
[Describe the technical strategy in detail.  
Explain *how* the sprint will be executed across Strides.  
This may include:]

- Chosen libraries, frameworks, modules  
- High-level architecture references  
- Patterns or constraints from `.stride/project.md`  
- Rationale behind sequencing of Strides  
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)  
- Code structure and module boundaries  
- Coordination with any external systems  
- How risks will be contained during implementation  

This section MUST answer:  
- *Why is this the right technical strategy?*  
- *How does this guarantee meeting acceptance criteria?*

---

## Dependencies
[List all dependencies—technical, environmental, organizational, or architectural.]

Examples:
- Requires API schema confirmation  
- Dependent on feature X being completed  
- Depends on stable version of library Y  
- Requires environment variables or infrastructure provisioning  

For each dependency, specify:

- Whether it blocks execution  
- Whether it is known, predictable, or uncertain  
- Mitigation steps if unavailable

---

## Risks
[List systematic risks with mitigation strategies.]

Each risk MUST include:

**Risk:**  
[Describe the risk]

**Impact:**  
[High / Medium / Low + explanation]

**Mitigation:**  
[How this sprint plans to neutralize or avoid the risk]

Examples:
- Legacy components may behave unpredictably  
- Performance thresholds may not be achievable  
- Tight coupling between modules may complicate changes  
- Third-party limits may restrict behavior  

---

## Validation Plan
This section defines how the sprint will be validated before `/stride-complete`.

Specify:

### Functional Validation
- [List tests that must pass]  
- [List flows that must be validated]  
- [Criteria tied to Proposal’s acceptance criteria]

### Technical Validation
- Architecture alignment with `.stride/project.md`  
- Error handling and logging standards applied  
- Security rules enforced  
- API contract verified  

### Quality Gates
- No TODOs left  
- All Strides marked complete  
- All tasks marked complete  
- No missing fields in proposal/plan/design  
- `stride validate <sprint>` MUST pass with no warnings

---

## Completion Conditions
A sprint is complete when:

- All Strides are marked complete  
- All tasks are completed  
- All acceptance criteria are met  
- Implementation logs reflect each Stride accurately  
- No discrepancies remain after review  
- Retrospective can be generated without missing context
