# **1. Stride Workflow Overview**

Stride follows a **strict, file-governed, state-driven** 6-phase lifecycle.

Sprint folder structure:

```
.stride/sprints/
  sprint-[name]/
    proposal.md
    plan.md
    design.md
    implementation.md
    retrospective.md
```

### **Agents MUST follow this sequence strictly:**

1. **Init** → Establish project context
2. **Plan** → Create proposal + plan + optional design
3. **Present** → Wait for explicit approval
4. **Implement** → Execute Strides sequentially
5. **Review** → Validate outputs
6. **Complete** → Finalize & reflect

### **Global Behavioural Rules**

* ❗ Never modify a file outside its allowed phase
* ❗ Never alter folder structure
* ❗ Never revise old implementation logs (append-only)
* ❗ Never add/remove top-level sections inside templates
* ✔ Follow templates exactly
* ✔ Preserve separation between proposal → plan → design → implementation

---

# **1.1 What Are Strides? (Canonical Definition)**

A **Stride** is a **phase-level execution unit** inside a sprint.
It sits *between* the sprint and the tasks:

```
Sprint
 ├─ Stride 1 (Milestone)
 │    ├─ Task 1.1
 │    ├─ Task 1.2
 │    └─ Task 1.3
 ├─ Stride 2 (Milestone)
 │    ├─ Task 2.1
 │    └─ Task 2.2
 └─ Stride 3 (Milestone)
      ├─ Task 3.1
      └─ Task 3.2
```

### **Definition**

A **Stride** is a *logical, reviewable milestone* within a sprint that:

* Produces a tangible outcome
* Groups several related tasks
* Moves the sprint from one capability stage to the next
* Must be executed **sequentially**
* Must appear in `plan.md`
* Must appear in implementation logs
* Must be referenced in the retrospective

### **Rules for Strides**

1. **Sequential** — Strides MUST be completed in order.
2. **Outcome-Based** — Each Stride MUST deliver a meaningful system milestone.
3. **Traceable** — Every Stride MUST map 1:1 to implementation logs.
4. **Stable After Approval** — Strides only change via `/stride-feedback`.
5. **Testable** — Each Stride MUST satisfy at least one acceptance criterion.
6. **Distinct From Tasks** — Tasks are atomic actions; Strides are milestone bundles.

---

# **2. Project Context (`/stride-init`)**

### **Goal**

Establish `.stride/project.md` as the **source-of-truth** for all sprints.

### **Agent Behaviour**

1. Check if `.stride/project.md` exists.
2. If missing → derive from repo or ask user for missing info.
3. Populate strictly using `.stride/templates/project.md`.
4. Planning cannot begin until this file is complete.

### **Rules**

`.stride/project.md` defines:

* Boundaries & scope
* Testing expectations
* Architectural conventions
* Coding standards
* Validation requirements
* Risks & assumptions

Agents MUST consult this file before every sprint.

---

# **3. Sprint Planning (`/stride-plan`)**

### **Goal**

Create a complete, reviewable sprint contract **before** coding begins.

### **Agent Behaviour**

1. Create:

```
.stride/sprints/sprint-[SHORTNAME]/
```

**SHORTNAME rules:**

* 4–12 chars
* Human readable
* Domain-relevant
* Unique

2. Generate the 3 planning files using template sources in `.stride/templates/`.

---

## **3.1 proposal.md**

Template Source: `.stride/templates/proposal.md`

Purpose: Define **intent, problem, boundaries, acceptance**.

Rules:

* High-level only
* NO architecture
* NO tasks
* Acceptance criteria MUST be measurable

---

## **3.2 plan.md**

Template Source: `.stride/templates/plan.md`

Purpose: Convert intent into:

* **Strides** (execution milestones)
* **Tasks** (atomic units)
* **Approach**
* **Risks**

Rules:

* Strides MUST be sequential & outcome-driven
* Tasks MUST map to implementation logs
* No code allowed

---

## **3.3 design.md** *(only if required)*

Template Source: `.stride/templates/design.md`

Rules:

* Required for architecture, APIs, data models, security, or cross-module changes
* Must capture decisions & trade-offs
* MUST remain aligned with `.stride/project.md`
* No implementation details

---

# **4. Presentation Phase (`/stride-present`)**

### **Goal**

Obtain explicit approval before implementation.

### **Agent Behaviour**

* Summarize proposal, plan, design
* Present Strides clearly
* Ask:
  **“Approve to proceed?”**

### **Rules**

* Read-only phase
* No implementation may begin without approval

---

# **5. Implementation Phase (`/stride-implement`)**

### **Goal**

Execute Strides and document work accurately.

### **Agent Behaviour**

* Execute Strides in strict order
* For each atomic change → append to `implementation.md`

### **Template Source:** `.stride/templates/implementation.md`

Rules:

* Append-only
* Each log must correspond to a Stride and its tasks
* Logs must be:
  * Factual
  * Chronological
  * Linked to deliverables
* Code changes must be summarized, not dumped

---

# **6. Feedback Phase (`/stride-feedback`)**

### **Goal**

Apply mid-sprint corrections safely and update project context if major changes discovered.

### **Agent Behaviour**

1. Pause implementation
2. Append "Feedback Received" to implementation log
3. Update:
   * `plan.md` (Strides & tasks)
   * `design.md` (if architecture changed)
4. **Check for Project-Level Impact** (Conditional)
   
   If feedback reveals changes that affect project-wide understanding, update `.stride/project.md` immediately:
   
   **Update project.md when feedback includes:**
   - New technical constraints discovered
   - Architecture patterns that should be standardized across project
   - Domain knowledge that generalizes beyond this sprint
   - Risk assumptions proven incorrect
   - Security or compliance requirements changed
   - Performance characteristics that affect project expectations
   
   **Sections most likely to need updates:**
   - Section 7: Domain Knowledge (entities, rules, relationships)
   - Section 8: Constraints (technical, business, operational)
   - Section 11: Risks & Assumptions (validations, new risks)
   
   **Process:**
   - Read current `.stride/project.md`
   - Identify which section(s) need updates
   - Append new learnings (preserve existing content)
   - Use format: `- [Description] (sprint-[NAME]): [Details]`
   - Log the project.md change in `implementation.md` under "Changes Applied"

5. Resume implementation

Rules:

* Must preserve original intent unless user says otherwise
* Must not violate acceptance criteria
* Project.md updates must be factual and traceable to this sprint

---

# **7. Review Phase (`/stride-review`)**

### **Goal**

Validate sprint output before completion.

### **Agent Behaviour**

Validate against:

* proposal.md
* plan.md
* design.md
* `.stride/project.md`
* All acceptance criteria

Run checks on:

* Code quality
* Tests
* Architecture alignment
* Documentation completeness

Rules:

* Entire phase is read-only
* Must list discrepancies
* Fixes require `/stride-feedback`

---

# **8. Completion Phase (`/stride-complete`)**

### **Goal**

Finalize sprint, produce learnings, and update project context based on insights.

### **Agent Behaviour**

1. **Review Sprint Learnings**
   - Analyze `implementation.md` for insights gained during sprint
   - Identify if any learnings affect project-wide context
   
2. **Update `.stride/project.md` (Conditional)**
   
   If sprint revealed project-level insights, update relevant sections:
   
   **Common scenarios requiring updates:**
   - Domain entities or business rules discovered → Update Section 7
   - New library restrictions or version requirements → Update Section 8.1
   - Performance benchmarks measured → Update Section 3.1
   - Security patterns established → Update Section 3.3
   - Operational constraints identified → Update Section 8.3
   - Assumptions validated or invalidated → Update Section 11
   
   **How to update:**
   - Read current section content
   - Append new learnings (don't delete existing content)
   - Use format: `- [Description] (sprint-[NAME]): [Details]`
   - Be specific and factual
   
3. **Generate `retrospective.md`**
   - Use template from `.stride/templates/retrospective.md`
   - Complete all sections including "Project Context Updates"
   - Reference specific Strides and decisions made
   - Document all project.md changes in "Project Context Updates" section
   
4. **Mark sprint as complete**
   - Provide final summary in chat
   - List project.md sections updated (if any)

Rules:

* No new tasks added here
* Retrospective MUST reference each Stride
* All project.md updates must be documented in retrospective

---

# **9. CLI Commands (Human Tools)**

| `stride validate <sprint>` | Verify completeness   |

Validation checks include:

* Required files exist
* Strides completed
* Logs present & consistent
* No TODOs left
* Acceptance criteria satisfied

---

# **12. Advanced Commands**

## **12.1 `/stride-derive` - Sprint Discovery**

### **Goal**

Analyze project context and codebase to derive multiple actionable sprint proposals, ranked by priority and effort.

### **Agent Behaviour**

1. Verify `.stride/project.md` exists (require `/stride-init` if missing)
2. Read all 11 sections of project.md to understand constraints, goals, domain
3. Scan `.stride/sprints/` directory to identify existing sprints and avoid duplicates
4. Search codebase for opportunities:
   - TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
   - Missing tests or documentation
   - Code smells (duplication, long functions, hard-coded values)
   - Security gaps
   - Performance bottlenecks
5. Cross-reference all ideas against project constraints (Section 8)
6. Generate 5-7 sprint proposals with:
   - Sprint name (4-12 chars, unique)
   - Priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)
   - Effort (S/M/L/XL)
   - Problem statement
   - Value proposition
   - Dependencies
7. Rank proposals by priority, then by value/effort ratio
8. Present in Rich table format with color coding
9. Guide user to select one and use `/stride-plan <sprint-name>`

### **Priority Guidelines**

* **P0 (Critical)**: Blockers, critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, compliance requirements
* **P1 (High)**: Major features, high-impact improvements, significant technical debt
* **P2 (Medium)**: Minor features, moderate improvements, nice-to-haves
* **P3 (Low)**: Polish, optimizations, exploratory work

### **Effort Guidelines**

* **S (Small)**: 1-2 days, < 50 lines, single file, clear scope
* **M (Medium)**: 3-5 days, < 200 lines, 2-5 files, well-defined
* **L (Large)**: 1-2 weeks, < 500 lines, multiple modules, some complexity
* **XL (Extra Large)**: 2+ weeks, > 500 lines, architectural changes, high complexity

### **Output Format**

Present sprint proposals in a Rich table:

```
╭─────────────────────── Sprint Proposals ───────────────────────╮
│ # │ Name        │ Pri │ Effort │ Problem           │ Value     │
│───┼─────────────┼─────┼────────┼───────────────────┼───────────│
│ 1 │ auth-jwt    │ P0  │ M      │ No authentication │ Security  │
│ 2 │ error-log   │ P1  │ S      │ Silent failures   │ Debug     │
│ ...                                                             │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### **Rules**

* MUST be read-only (no file creation)
* MUST check for `.stride/project.md` first
* MUST scan existing sprints to avoid duplicates
* MUST validate all proposals against project constraints
* MUST present 5-7 proposals minimum
* MUST rank by priority and value/effort
* MUST guide user to `/stride-plan` after selection
* Output MUST use Rich table formatting

---

## **12.2 `/stride-lite` - Lightweight Workflow**

### **Goal**

Execute small changes following Five-Stage Workflow entirely in chat without creating sprint files.

### **Lite-Eligibility Criteria**

Change must meet ALL criteria:

* **Lines Changed**: < 50 lines total
* **Files Affected**: < 3 files
* **Single Concern**: One specific fix/change only
* **No Architecture**: No design decisions or API changes
* **No Security Impact**: No auth or sensitive data
* **No New Features**: Bug fixes, styling, docs, configs only

If ANY criterion fails → abort and suggest `/stride-plan`.

### **Five-Stage Process (Chat-Based)**

#### **Stage 1: TALK (Discovery)**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Estimate scope (lines, files, complexity)
- Validate lite-eligibility against all 6 criteria
- If eligible → proceed
- If not → abort and suggest `/stride-plan`

#### **Stage 2: PLAN (Design)**
- List all files to be modified
- Describe specific changes (with line numbers if known)
- Explain reasoning and impact
- Show before/after snippets (optional)
- Ask: "Proceed with this plan?"

#### **Stage 3: CONFIRM (Approval)**
- Wait for explicit "Proceed" or "Yes"
- If user requests changes → update plan and recheck eligibility
- If scope expands beyond limits → abort
- Never skip this stage

#### **Stage 4: IMPLEMENT (Execution)**
- Make approved changes
- Monitor scope (abort if exceeds 50 lines)
- Explain each modification in chat
- Show diffs or summaries (not full file dumps)
- Confirm changes applied

#### **Stage 5: COMPLETE (Verification)**
- Provide final summary
- List all changes (files, line counts)
- Confirm quality checks
- Offer follow-up assistance
- No files created (chat-only)

### **Abort Conditions**

Stop and suggest `/stride-plan` if:
- Scope exceeds 50 lines or 3 files
- Architecture decisions needed
- Security concerns emerge
- Multiple concerns discovered
- Complexity grows beyond lite scope

### **Rules**

* MUST validate eligibility in TALK stage
* MUST follow all 5 stages (no skipping)
* MUST get explicit approval in CONFIRM stage
* MUST abort if scope exceeds limits
* MUST NOT create any files or directories
* MUST NOT log to implementation.md
* MUST NOT update project.md
* ALL communication in chat only

---

## **12.3 `/stride-status` - Conversational Status**

### **Goal**

Provide deep, conversational project status with progress analysis, blocker identification, and actionable recommendations.

### **Agent Behaviour**

1. Validate `.stride/project.md` exists (require `/stride-init` if missing)
2. Scan `.stride/sprints/` directory for all sprint folders
3. For each sprint:
   - Determine lifecycle phase (file existence)
   - If ACTIVE:
     - Parse `plan.md`: count total Strides in "## Strides" section
     - Parse `implementation.md`: count completed Stride logs (pattern: `## [Timestamp] Stride:`)
     - Calculate: `completion_pct = (completed / total) × 100`
     - Extract current Stride from latest log
     - Scan for blocker keywords: "blocker", "blocked", "cannot proceed", "waiting for"
     - Check staleness: `days_since_update > 7`
4. Calculate project health:
   - **Blocked**: any sprint has active blockers
   - **At Risk**: > 2 stale sprints OR no active work with many proposed
   - **Healthy**: normal operation
5. Generate recommendations:
   - Blocked sprints → suggest resolution
   - High completion (> 90%) → suggest `/stride-review`
   - Stale sprints → suggest `/stride-feedback` or `/stride-complete`
   - No active work → suggest starting proposed sprints
6. Format as conversational prose with emojis
7. Present naturally with encouragement

### **Progress Calculation**

**Total Strides** (from `plan.md`):
```
Find section: ## Strides (Sub-Tasks)
Count numbered items: 1. **Stride 1:**, 2. **Stride 2:**, etc.
```

**Completed Strides** (from `implementation.md`):
```
Find all logs: ## [Timestamp] Stride: [Name]
Extract unique Stride names
Count unique Strides
```

**Percentage**:
```
completion = (completed_strides / total_strides) × 100
```

### **Blocker Detection**

Search `implementation.md` for keywords:
- "blocker", "blocked"
- "cannot proceed", "waiting for"
- "needs clarification", "dependency missing"

Extract context around keyword for description.

### **Health Assessment**

```
IF any sprint has blockers → Blocked 🚫
ELSE IF stale_count > 2 → At Risk ⚠️
ELSE IF active == 0 AND proposed > 5 → At Risk ⚠️
ELSE → Healthy ✅
```

### **Output Format**

Conversational prose with structure:

```
Project Health: {status} {emoji}

Active Sprints ({count}):
{sprint_id} is {pct}% complete
- Currently on Stride {n} of {total}: "{name}"
- {blocker_status}
- Next: {action}

Proposed Sprints ({count}): {names}

Completed Recently:
- {sprint} ({days} days ago)

Recommendations:
1. {action_1}
2. {action_2}
```

### **Rules**

* MUST be read-only (no file modifications)
* MUST parse logs for accurate progress
* MUST identify all blockers from keywords
* MUST calculate completion percentages
* MUST generate specific recommendations
* Output MUST be conversational prose (not tables)
* MUST use emojis: ✅ ⚠️ 🚫
* MUST be encouraging and constructive

---

# **Final Notes (Authoritative)**

* `.stride/project.md` = **global project contract**
* `proposal.md` = **intent**
* `plan.md` = **contract & Stride definition**
* `design.md` = **technical blueprint**
* `implementation.md` = **execution log (append-only)**
* `retrospective.md` = **learning archive**

Stride is a **file-driven, spec-enforced, agent-governed engineering system.**
Agents MUST follow these rules precisely to ensure consistent, auditable, high-quality development.
